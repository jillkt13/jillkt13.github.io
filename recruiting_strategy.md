# Developing an inclusive and data-driven user research recruiting strategy

Our ragtag research team had developed its recruiting practices out of pure scrappiness: whomever we could easily get to come to the lab or sign up for a remote interview was usually selected as a participant. We hadn’t given much thought to whether or not we were speaking to the right users. And given strategic shifts in our business model, we wanted to make sure that going forward, we would be speaking to the participants best positioned to provide feedback on our product and its future. 

**My challenge:** Develop a recruiting strategy that ensures that we are speaking to participants that will give us the best data as we produce insights to drive product and design decisions, taking into account possible shifts in our user base as our product evolves.

## Method and Approach

### Stakeholder Interviews

As a newcomer to the company, I scheduled 10 interviews with key stakeholders in our leadership, including the VP of Design, the CEO, the Marketing Director, and more. During our 30-minute conversations, I probed them on two main questions: the demographics of our users right now and the demographics of our future users given a slew of strategic product changes. 

### Strategy Development

Based on these internal interviews, I developed a recruiting strategy to ensure our participants represented the demographics that we actually considered to be significant audiences. For example, I found that international users were seen to be drivers of growth and an important user base; however, our research team had spoken to less than 10 international users over the past year. Therefore, one pillar of the strategy was to speak to 20% of participants from outside of English-speaking countries.

### Implementation and monitoring

Once I finished the recruiting strategy, I shifted to implementation. Now my focus was tactics: how do I get the types of users described in the strategy into a conversation with our research team? I created a document that listed the various types of users we would be targeting going forward and then brainstormed tactics that would work well for that particular audience. I cast a wide net when it came to tactics, to ensure not only that we would be getting a diverse set of participants but also to provide Plan B options in case of an unsuccessful initial recruitment. 

My work was not done after creating the strategy and identifying the tactics that would allow us to have a steady recruitment pipeline. In order to continually improve, I now conduct quarterly recruitment audits. In these audits, I reflect on difficult recruitments to decide how to optimize for the future. For example, after a round of user testing with a high no-show rate, I collected data on the participants and the method of recruitment in order to see if certain groups were more prone to no-showing and if certain recruitment outreach messaging was more successful in reducing no-shows. During these audits, I also make sure that the participants we spoke to match the demographics decided in the recruiting strategy. 

## Impact

* Our recruiting is now based on evidence. It is inclusive and diverse, better reflecting the people we want to serve with our product
* Not only are we speaking to better participants, but also recruiting is faster and easier. We have a list of tactics that are customized to very specific audiences and demographics, in order to reach them best
* We are speaking to more people than ever before, and they are more thoughtfully selected in order to provide the most impactful insights. For example, in a recent round of research on search, we spoke to several non-English speaking participants and discovered wildly different approaches when it comes to conducting searches in a non-native language. Without our stated goal of reaching out to international audiences, we likely would have never spoken to these individuals and made this discovery

## Reflections

* *Don’t rely on a single source of data:* Our recruiting decisions were previously driven by internal knowledge of the research team. By reaching out to a broader group of stakeholders, I heard a ton of new information about our users. The User Research team likes to consider itself the experts on our users, but there is still much to learn outside of that bubble. Google Analytics, past surveys, and other business stakeholders provided loads of new data.
* *Complacency can lead to stasis:* In agile environments, we’re often working towards an MVP or something that’s “good enough.” Our prior recruiting practices were “good enough”; we were getting good insights. But now we know that by periodically interrogating those practices and the underlying assumptions, we can be much more strategic in our approach. Even the quarterly recruiting audits have done wonders to identify gaps, leading to optimization for recruitment times and getting a more inclusive pool of participants.
