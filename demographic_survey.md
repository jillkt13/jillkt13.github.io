# Foundational user demographic research

My company offered two websites with similar missions but a strikingly different online presence: JSTOR and Artstor. JSTOR is an online academic database for researchers in the social sciences and humanities; Artstor is an online academic database offering high-quality image content to researchers in the Arts. Strategically, the leadership team had decided to bring these two distinct websites closer together, in the belief that researchers on one site might benefit from the resources available on the other site. 

**My challenge:** Unearth the similarities and differences between the Artstor and JSTOR user groups, in order to create a foundation for uniting these platforms 

## Method and Approach

### Survey development

I decided that an intercept survey on both sites would be the best way to collect demographic information at scale to assess high-level similarities and differences between these two groups. 

From the outset, I saw this project as an opportunity to conduct foundational research that would not only serve the research, design, and product teams, but also the broader organization, including sales, marketing, and content teams. For that reason, I started by recording the goals for the survey and then meeting with colleagues throughout the organization to brainstorm survey question ideas that would meet the goals I’d defined but also feed into their team’s work on this initiative. 

Our stated goals for this research were:
1. Understand the similarities and differences between Artstor and JSTOR users
2. Learn which users were using which features and why, in order to provide concrete insights into bringing the sites together

### Survey analysis

From those conversations and a good deal of brainstorming on my own, I developed a long list of possible survey questions. The next phase pushed me to narrow the scope until I had a cohesive set of questions that served the project’s goals and would also be of a manageable length to respond. Next up was a long phase of massaging the wording of the questions, to be sure we were not influencing the answer in any way.

With over 10,000 responses, I could have spent weeks interpreting the data, cross-tabulating every possible variable. But I returned to my goals for the project, as well as the inciting business need, to concentrate my analysis. Most of the analysis was conducted in Qualtrics. I narrowed to five areas of focus, looking at the trends within each user group and between each user group for each area: 
* Types of content preferences
* Sharing and using content
* Demographic information
* Search satisfaction and behavior
* International users 

I packaged the results from each of these areas into a cohesive story about our users and shared it widely throughout the organization. I held meetings where I shared a summary deck and discussed implications and also organized a weeklong share-out in our team's Slack channel where we share user insights. I showed where the user groups were vastly different and what risks and opportunities might arise from those differences. 

## Impact

* The user research team heavily depends on the demographic survey as we think through new research projects. In meetings where we discuss a new problem or brainstorm research on a new topic, it’s not uncommon to hear, “Do we have any insight from the demographic survey on this point?” It’s essential to the way we frame our questions and think about our users. 
* By including stakeholders from other teams in the survey development and by sharing the results with them, the user research team found new collaborators outside of the product teams that we usually work with. For example, after I presented the results about content and metadata to our Content team, they asked follow-up questions that sparked an additional round of research to dive into their questions. Similarly, the marketing team asked to collaborate on a round of research about the risks of combining these two websites. Thanks to this survey, I expanded the influence of user research throughout the organization. 
* The demographic survey became a foundational project for not only our research team but also the broader organization. As a result, we decided it was worthwhile to conduct this survey annually in order to compare year-to-year data. I developed a set of goals for the annual survey, designing it to provide data that would allow us to study trends over time but also to evolve in a way that it could answer the most pressing questions on our organization’s mind during the year it is conducted. The most recent iteration of the survey was highly appreciated by senior leadership, with one VP saying “This initiative was terrific on a number of fronts, both in terms of trend data that will help us to benchmark and practical suggestions for how we can improve.”

## Reflections

* *Try something new*: our user research team was quite adept at gathering insights in an agile model, working in lockstep with a product team on their sprint goals. We were also quite good at leveraging two data extremes: the rich and informative qualitative data from less than a dozen user interviews and the millions of quantitative data points from our analytics. But we had less experience conducting occasional big foundational projects based on data from the middle of the spectrum: a few thousand responses to a survey, with some open-text questions and some simple multiple choice. I wasn’t sure if a large survey was the right approach to this work, but by trying it, I see the payoff. 

* *Generate insights that last longer than your product roadmap*: While quick evaluative research that might only be relevant for a few months is necessary, user researchers need to think bigger. I learned the value of large projects that can inform over the span of years. This research not only allowed us to compare over time, to let us benchmark and see how we’re doing, but also helped (and will continue to help!) us think of new research questions to tackle.
