  A former social science researcher who transitioned to UX Research, I execute quantitative and qualitative research studies to support design decisions and drive product initiatives. My favorite question is “Why?” and I use the answers to help make people's lives easier and better. My greatest strength is transforming data into strategic principles and business impact.

  I have studied and worked in both the United States and France. Please contact me with opportunities in User Research, Product Management, and UX Strategy in either of the countries.
