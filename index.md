## Hi, I'm Jill, a user researcher with experience in the United States and France.

A former social science researcher who transitioned to UX Research, I execute quantitative and qualitative research studies to support design decisions and drive product initiatives. My favorite question is “Why?” and I use the answers to help make people's lives easier and better. My greatest strength is transforming data into strategic principles and business impact. 

Here is an <a href="https://ethn.io/blog/ithaka_mobile">article</a> I published about some research at my current company. 

I have studied and worked in both the United States and France. Please [contact me](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaM0dB94QPEt9lZqslmL7no4zA9TQ5sY0UnriuiNYZ7fjk-w/viewform?usp=sf_link) with opportunities in User Research, Product Management, and UX Strategy in either of the countries.
